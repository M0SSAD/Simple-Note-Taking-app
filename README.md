#  Simple Note Taking App

A cross-platform note-taking application leveraging Rust for the backend, a cutting-edge AI-generated frontend, and the power of blockchain technology.

---

##  Overview

This project is a simple, efficient note-taking app designed for speed, privacy, and modern user experience.

- **Backend:** Built with Rust for performance, safety, and reliability.
- **Frontend:** Fully generated using Claude Sonnet 4 (Anthropic AI) for a clean, intuitive, and modern UI.
- **Blockchain:** Integrated with the Internet Computer blockchain for decentralized data storage and enhanced security.

---

##  Features

- Create, edit, and delete notes instantly.
- Organized, minimal UI for productivity.
- Secure, decentralized note storage using the Internet Computer blockchain.
- Lightning-fast performance thanks to Rust-powered backend and efficient frontend.

##  Internet Computer Blockchain Integration

This app utilizes the [Internet Computer blockchain](https://internetcomputer.org/) to provide decentralized, tamper-proof, and scalable storage for your notes.  
By leveraging the Internet Computer, your data is:

- **Secure:** Notes are stored on a decentralized blockchain network, reducing the risks of data breaches and centralized points of failure.
- **Accessible:** Access your notes from anywhere, with the assurance that your data is always available.
- **Censorship-resistant:** Data is not controlled by any single entity, ensuring true ownership and privacy.
